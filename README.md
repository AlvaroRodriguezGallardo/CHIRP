Project and presentation about CHIRP algorithm, for Visi√≥n por Computador, subject at University of Granada.

Algorithm proposed in Bouman et al. Paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01413.pdf). The main aim was imaging black holes, but it could be used with other celestial bodies.
